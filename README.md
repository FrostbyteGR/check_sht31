# check_sht31

## I. DESCRIPTION:

SHT31-D Sensor nagios plugin for Single Board Computers

Copyright (c) 2017 Frostbyte <frostbytegr@gmail.com>

Check environment temperature and humidity with SHT31-D via I2C

## II. CREDITS:

* <github.com/sfeakes> - adafruit sht31 for raspberry pi code
* <devel@nagios-plugins.org> - plugin development guidelines

## III. FEATURES:

* Output includes perfdata
* Threshold ranges (min/max) for both temperature and humidity
* Both warning and critical thresholds may be fully or partially omitted
  - Anything that has not been explicitly specified will be disabled
* Only allows for threshold ranges that are within the sensor's documented capabilities
  - Temperature: from -40 to 125 Â°C
  - Humidity: from 0 to 100 % RH
* Output validation against the sensor's CRC values and documented capabilities
  - If measured data are invalid, will retry every 1 second for a maximum of 3 times
* Execution of additional sensor commands
  - getEnvData, getSerial, getStatus, clearStatus, softReset, heaterEnable, heaterDisable

## IV. SUPPORTED DEVICES:

* Raspberry Pi
* Raspberry Pi 2
* Raspberry Pi 3
* ASUS Tinker Board

**NOTES:** If using a Raspberry Pi, connect your sensor to the SDA1/SCL1 pins instead of the SDA0/SCL0 ones, to avoid I2C detection issues.

## VI. INSTALLATION:

1. Give execution permissions to the build script and execute it:
   - chmod u+x build && ./build
2. Copy the compiled plugin to the nagios plugins directory:
   - sudo cp bin/check_sht31 /usr/local/lib/nagios/plugins/check_sht31
3. Allow nagios/icinga to execute the plugin as sudo, by adding this entry to the sudoers file:
   - nagios ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/lib/nagios/plugins/check_sht31
4. Figure out from which bus you can access the sensor:
   - ls -la /dev/i2c-*
   - apt-get install i2c-tools libi2c-dev
   - sudo i2cdetect -r <bus_number> (a value of 44 should exist in the table)

## VII. USAGE:

* sudo check_sht31 -b <i2c_bus_num> [-w tmp_warn_range,hum_warn_range] [-c tmp_crit_range,hum_crit_range]
  - example: sudo check_sht31 -b 1 -w 10:40,30:70 -c 5:45,25:75
